  1. Discuss large changes on the mailing list or trac before coding.
  2. Python code style should follow PEP8 standards whenever possible
     (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
  3. Write tests!  Tons of great information here:
     http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/
  4. For non-trivial contributions, agree to the contributor agreement:
     http://localwiki.org/cla

Email issue a GitHub pull request, email patches to philip@localwiki.org, or
post them to the LocalWiki development mailing list.

Please also see our ticketing system at:

  https://github.com/localwiki/localwiki/issues

Picking out some tickets to work on is a great way to get started on the 
project!

Come talk to us in the #localwiki IRC channel on freenode.net!  Because the
project is just getting started, things are moving rather quickly.  IRC is a
great way to quickly chat about functionality and plans!

== Simple git workflow ==

If using GitHub:

   1. Fork on GitHub (click Fork button)
   2. Clone to computer ($ git clone git@github.com:you/localwiki.git )
   3. Set up remote upstream
      ($ git remote add upstream git://github.com/localwiki/localwiki.git)
   4. Create a branch for new issue ($ git checkout -b 100-new-feature)
   5. Develop on issue branch.
      [Time passes, the main LocalWiki repository accumulates new commits]
   6. Commit changes to issue branch
      ($ git add . ; git commit -m 'commit message')
   7. Fetch upstream ($ git fetch upstream)
   8. Update local master ($ git checkout master; git pull upstream master)
   9. Repeat steps 5-8 till dev is complete
  10. Rebase issue branch ($ git checkout 100-new-feature; git rebase master)
  11. Push branch to GitHub ($ git push origin 100-new-feature)
  12. Issue pull request (Click Pull Request button)

If not using GitHub:

  Follow the same basic pattern (develop on branch until done), then rebase to
  remote master when you're done.  Send your patch using git format-patch to
  philip@localwiki.org or provide a remote git URL to pull from.
