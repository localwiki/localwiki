LocalWiki is a web application that includes collaborative editing and
mapping and is designed for collecting and sharing information in local,
geographic communities. Depends on python, apache2, postgis, and jetty.

See `localwiki.org <http://localwiki.org>`_ for much more information.

Installation
=============

We recommend that non-developers install via the Ubuntu package.
Details here:

   http://localwiki.org/install

You can install localwiki via pip, but you'll need to follow the usual
installation steps and make sure you have the system-level prerequisites.
See our INSTALL file:

   https://github.com/localwiki/localwiki/blob/master/INSTALL

You'll just subsitute 'pip install localwiki' for 'python setup.py install'.
Everything else remains the same.
