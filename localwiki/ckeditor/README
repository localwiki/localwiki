A ckeditor django app we've created.  Does nice things like checks for allowed XHTML
elements and optionally renders buttons based on pre-defined allowed elements.

This editor whitelists allowed elements/attributes to combat XSS attacks.
The included test suite can test against a known list of XSS attacks.

===========================
There's nothing LocalWiki-specific in this ckeditor at the moment.  When that
does happen we'll try and spin off a separate ckeditor app and have our own
'editor' app that uses the spinned-off ckeditor app.
