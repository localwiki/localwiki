For now, a theme is simply a directory containing:

    A directory with Django templates ('templates')
    A directory with static assets ('assets') 

Themes live in this directory, themes/.

After changing themes around you'll want to make sure to set your SITE_THEME setting and run:

python manage.py collectstatic

Otherwise the files won't be served unless you're using the development server.

== Referring to static assets ==

Your theme templates can refer to static assets like this!--

<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}theme/img/mybutton.png"/>

That will pull up the file that lives at themes/yourtheme/img/mybutton.png.

== Over-riding built-in templates ==

To over-ride pages/base.html, you simply define themes/themename/templates/pages/base.html.
