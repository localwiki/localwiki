``django-versionutils``
===============================================

``django-versionutils`` is a collection of reusable Django apps designed
to provide everything you need to do robust, smart and extendable versioning,
diffing and merging when working with Django.

The ``django-versionutils`` project was initially developed for the `LocalWiki
project`_.  We wanted a way to abstract out the often tedious
versioning-related aspects of writing a wiki system.  When looking at
all the existing versioning systems for Django, we found none suited our
needs.
