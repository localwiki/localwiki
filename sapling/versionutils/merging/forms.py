class MergeMixin(object):
    """
    ModelForm mixin that detects editing conflicts.  For example, consider
    the following scenario:

    User A obtains a form to edit model instance M
    User B obtains a form to edit the same instance
    User B makes some changes and submits the form.  M is updated.
    User A makes some changes and submits the form.  B's changes are lost.

    MergeMixin will check to see if anyone else has edited the
    associated model since the form was loaded.  If so, a ValidationError is
    raised with the provided conflict_error.

    To perform a merge in this case, simply subclass MergeMixin and provide
    your own merge() method.

    As long as the associated model is versioned using versioning.register
    or has a DateTimeField with auto_now=True this will work automatically.
    Otherwise you'll want to subclass MergeMixin and override
    get_version_date().

    NOTE: You need to list MergeMixin before ModelForm in your
    subclasses list.  Example::

        class PageForm(MergeMixin, forms.ModelForm):
            class Meta:
                model = Page
                fields = ('content',)

    Attributes:
        conflict_error: The optional warning string to return alongside
            ValidationError on a conflict.
        merge_success_msg: The optional string to send as a message if a
            merge successfully occurs.
        version_date_field: Optional field name to use for figuring out
            the version date.  We infer this automatically if the associated
            model is versioned using versioning.register or has an
            auto_now=True DateTimeField.  You probably want to override
            get_version_date() instead of using this attribute.
