Installing
==========

The easiest way to install LocalWiki is by using our Ubuntu package.

Installing on Ubuntu
--------------------

LocalWiki is available as a prebuilt package for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or newer.

For Ubuntu 12.04 or newer, just open a terminal and run these commands::

   sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:localwiki
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install localwiki

For Ubuntu 12.10, the apt-add-repository package has moved::

   sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

That's it! Follow the prompts to configure LocalWiki.

.. _dev-install:

Installing on other systems
---------------------------

.. note:: This installation method should only be used if you can't use
   the Ubuntu package or if you want to set up a development
   enviroment.

See our ``INSTALL`` file for detailed instructions.  The file is also included
here:

.. literalinclude:: ../../INSTALL
