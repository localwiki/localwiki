Subscriber list
===============

As a website administrator, you often want to send updates or newsletters to
your users. To do this, you need a list of email addresses. But it's not nice
to send unsolicited email without a person's permission, so LocalWiki provides
an opt-in list.

When users register on your LocalWiki site, they can opt-in to receive email
updates. Those who opt-in are added to a list, which is available to you,
the administrator, at this address:

  ``http://<your server's address>/admin/subscribers/``

From here, you can copy this list and import it into your email software.
