This is a version of the daisydiff HTML diffing library that's we've modified
in a few ways.  Some noteworthy changes:

  * Diffing is rendered in the classic wiki side-by-side manner.
  * Diffing can be provided as a service rather than simply via a
    command-line app.  This dramatically improves performance.
  * Three-way merging is supported.  This is essential for resolving
    wiki edit conflicts.

Modifications will be pushed upstream where possible.  We will likely continue
improving this version of daisydiff and figure out what we want to do[1] at a
later, better point.

------
1. It doesn't look like DaisyDiff has been actively maintained in some while.
We may end up carrying the torch on this one.  We may end up rewriting this in
python at some point, too.
